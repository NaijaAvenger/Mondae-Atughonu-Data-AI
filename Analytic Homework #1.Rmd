```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Exercise 1

Try to create a markdown file (.Rmd) that includes one simple code chunk below (a). 

a. Sum of 100 and 200.

```{r}
100+200
```

What is the sum of 100 and 200?

```{r}
100+200
```


## Exercise 2

In Exercise 2, provide simple graphs as examples below.

a.

```{r}
plot(x=15,y=20,xlab = "Cars", ylab = "MPG")
```


b.

# Define the cars vector with 5 values

```{r}
cars <- c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
```


# Graph cars using green points overlayed by a line 

```{r}
plot(cars, type="o", col="green")
```


# Create a title with a orange, bold/italic font

```{r}
plot(cars,type="o",col="green",xlab="Cars",ylab="MPG",main="Cars Data", col.main = "orange", font.main=4)
```
